Description: Create a simple circut using two improvised swiches made from conductive cloth and other materials. 
TIP: When making a patch or button of conductive thread make sure to make it larger than you think you will need. It is far more likely to work.
Note: Note the key acting in place of the paper clip and thread patch because I could not hold the prototype and take a photo at the same time.
