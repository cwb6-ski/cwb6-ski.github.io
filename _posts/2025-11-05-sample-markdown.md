Description: Create a code that plays your name in morse code and then SOS when a switch is flipped or clips connected.
TIP: My Arduino does not work (confirmed). Check your code on someone elses Arduino before pulling your hair out. ALSO: realise that this is just code so stay calm and go to TA hours.
