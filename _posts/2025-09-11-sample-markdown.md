I am Cole Bothner calss of 2028. I am a prospective German and Economics major. I have little sewing expeirence but I have expeiremented with embroidery in the past. In this class I hope to develop a better understanding of the internet and how it works as well as an appreciation for modern technology and how it is developed. One _fun_ fact about me is that i love to eat bread with olive oil.
