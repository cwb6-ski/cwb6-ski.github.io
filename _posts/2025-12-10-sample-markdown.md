I constructed a scarf that, when it is cold outside and the scarf is being worn, will turn on lights and play Christmas music. The motivation behind this project was to solve two problems I have:

It is often cold in Williamstown.

I like to listen to music while I walk.

By combining these two problems—and adding lights for safety, my project idea was complete.

Tips:

The POGIL sheets are super useful; use them to help with the coding.

The previous assignments are very helpful when writing the code.

Be careful about how long your traces are—the lights will get dim if they are too far away.
