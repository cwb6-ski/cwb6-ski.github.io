I am Cole Bother. I am a student at Williams College. I am majoring in German and Economics with the hope of one day living abroad to persue my career. I am also a deadicated student athlete, competing for the Williams Nordic Ski team. As a student athlete I am working hard to strike a balance between prioritising my education and pursuing my potential in athletics. My goal as an athlete is to ski in the 2030 Winter Olympic Games in Nice, France. This goal, while by no means a given, is possible and motivates me to be the best I can be in all that I do.
